# X-Style Judging Guide

This document should help you judge X-Style runs.

## Judging Criteria

There is only one judging criteria: **Difficulty**<br>
Those riders who show the highest difficulty will win.

Learn more about difficulty: Here should be a link to a document explaining difficulty in all its dimensions (doesn't exist yet).

## Judging Strategies

X-Style is known for its fast judging and competition pace. Long judging is contraproductive to this and probably also means you are doing something wrong. For example, writing down all tricks is not necessary to accomplish a ranking and history has shown it takes too much time. 

Here are some strategies that can be used for X-Style judging:

### 1) Difficulty Bar

For each rider, draw a line (about half the size of a paper). Left is 0 right is 100. 0 means it is the lowest possible difficulty while 100 means it is the highest possible difficulty. Now for each trick a rider completes, stroke at where you rank the difficulty of that trick. At the end of the run the median of all strokes you have is the difficulty score for that run. Compare these scores with those from the other riders in the same group to create the finale ranking.

### 2) Immediate Ordering

After each run, you can rank the rider in regards to the others in that group. For example, the first rider will for sure be placed at rank 1. For the second rider you decide wether he was better or worse than the first rider and put him atop or below the first one. For the third rider you decide whether he was better or worse amongst other riders and put him first or last or somewhere in between the others. Continue doing this for each rider in that group. After the last rider is finished the final ranking is available immediately.
