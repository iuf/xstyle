# X-Style

X-Style is a new competition for Freestyle riders who mostly focus on skills.
It was designed to be more interesting and entertaining than Standard Skill for the competitors and the audience.
In X-Style every competitor gets 2 minutes time to show her skills to the judges.
The rider showing the most difficult skills wins the competition.
It doesn't matter how often a skill is tried or how many dismounts there are.
Only mastered skills count.
