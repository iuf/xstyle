# X-Style Rules
Competitors only care about skills.
The system finds at least the best 3 riders.

## Definitions

__Unicycle Skill__: The main action of a movement is done on and with the unicycle.

_Example 1_: If you do a handstand, while the unicycle is laying on the floor, this is a non unicycle trick, because the main action is the handstand.

_Example 2_: If you do a handstand on the unicycle, while it is standing upside down, this is a unicycle trick, because the main action is balancing the unicycle while doing the handstand.

## Runs
Every competitor has a 2 minute run.
The rider shows his/her skills during this time.
A DJ is playing music for each run.
After 2 minutes the DJ waits until the current skill is finished and stops the music. 
Riders can also hand in their own music.
Riders can request a time notification before their run from the DJ.
The DJ then gives a signal after one minute passed.

## Starting Groups
The group of competing riders is split into random starting groups of about the same size with maximum 10 riders.
There can be two distinct tournaments for junior (age less than 15) and senior (age 15 and older) riders.
If there are obvious critical groups (e.g. all the best riders in one group), the chief judge is allowed to modify the groups.

The host can decide to order the riders by age and then split them into starting groups.
The host is also allowed to hand out awards to intermediate winners.
This can be motivating for younger riders.

## Tournament
The best 3 riders of each group advance to the next round, forming a new pool of competitors.
If there is a tie on one of the first 3 places which extends to more than the 3 riders, all involved riders advance.
This pool again gets split into starting groups and the next round begins.
The final round consists of only one starting group.
In the final round the best 3 riders are awarded for the first, second and third place of the competition.

### Ties
If the competition doesn't allow ties (e.g. Unicon), the tied placed riders of the final round will be given another run.
The run will be one minute.
The judges bring all tied riders in order.
If there is still a tie between riders, the tie rules will be applied again, until all ties are resolved.

## Judges
The Chief Judge composes the Judging Table for each starting group.
All judges can be active competitors or non-competitors.
Preferred are people with judging experience and competitors.
Non-Competitors can apply for being a judge by contacting the Chief Judge in advance.
The Chief Judge sets the application deadline.
It is recommended that every starting group gets judged by another starting group.
The judging table consists of at least 5 Judges.

## Judging
Every routine is judged by the judging table.
One judging table stays for one starting group.
Judges can judge alone or in pairs.
Judging in pairs is the preferred system.
All judges must either judge alone or in pairs so that each judge's vote has equal weight.
(Pair judges are referred to as one judge below.)
The judge should rank the riders of the current starting group in order.
They should do this by comparing the difficulty of the shown skills.
Assigning one rank to multiple riders is allowed.

Only executed skills are taken into account.
An executed skill is defined as when the rider reaches the point of being in control.

Examples:

* The landing of a unispin is part of the skill.
The rider can only reach the point of being in control after landing.
If the rider is hopping 4 times without control and then falls off the unicycle, the skill does not count.
* In coasting, the rider is in control after getting far enough.
Getting back to pedals is a separate skill.

Negative aspects like dismounts are ignored.
Every judge can use blank sheets of paper to take notes.

The highest and the lowest placing points per rider are discarded.
All the remaining placing points get summed up for each rider.
The 3 riders with the fewest points win and advance to the next round.

## Publishing Results

The published results contain the riders total ranking in order with their summed placing points and the name(s) of the judges with their ranking for each rider.
