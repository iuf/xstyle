# X-Style Rules
Competitors only care about skills.
The system finds at least the best 3 riders.

## Runs
Every competitor has a two minute run.
The rider shows his skills during this time.
A DJ is playing music for each run.
Riders can also hand in their own music.

## Starting Groups
The group of competing riders gets split into random starting groups of about the same size with maximum 10 riders.
There can be two distinct tournaments for junior (age less than 15) and senior (age 15 and older) riders.
If there are obvious critical groups (e.g. all the best riders in one group), the chief judge is allowed to modify the groups.

The host can decide to order the riders by age and then split them into starting groups.
The host is also allowed to hand out awards to intermediate winners.
This can be motivating for younger/weaker riders.

## Tournament
The best 3 riders of each group advance to the next round, forming a new pool of competitors.
If there is a tie on one of the first 3 places which extends to more than the 3 riders, all riders involved in this tie advance.
This pool again gets split into starting groups and the next round begins.

## Judges
All judges can be active competitors or non-competitors.
Preferred are people with judging experience and competitors.
It is recommended that every starting group gets judged by another starting group.
The judging table consists of at least 5 Judges.

## Judging
Every routine is judged by the judging table.
One judging table stays for one starting group.
Judges can judge alone or in pairs.
The judge has to bring the riders of the current starting group in order by judging the difficulty of the shown skills.

Only mastered skills count. A skill is mastered when the rider reached the point of beeing in control.

Examples:

* The landing of a unispin is part of the skill. The rider can only reach the point of beeing in control after landing.
* In coasting, the rider is in control, after getting far enough. Getting back to pedals is a separate difficulty. The same applies for other riding skills.

Negative aspects like dismounts are ignored. Every judge can use blank sheets of paper to take notes.

All the placing points get summed up for each rider.
The 3 riders with the fewest points win and advance to the next round.
