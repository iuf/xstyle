# X-Style Rules
Competitors only care about skills.
The system finds at least the best 3 riders.

## Runs
Every competitor has a two minute run.
The rider shows his skills during this time.
A DJ is playing music for each run.
Riders can also hand in their own music.

## Starting Groups
The group of competing riders gets split into random starting groups of about the same size with maximum 10 riders.
There can be two distinct tournaments for junior (age less than 15) and senior (age 15 and older) riders.
If there are obvious critical groups (e.g. all the best riders in one group), the chief judge is allowed to modify the groups.

The host can decide to order the riders by age and then split them into starting groups.
The host is also allowed to hand out awards to intermediate winners.
This can be motivating for younger/weaker riders.

## Tournament
The best 3 riders of each group advance to the next round, forming a new pool of competitors.
This pool again gets split into starting groups and the next round begins.

## Judges
All judges can be active competitors or non-competitors.
Preferred are competitors and people with judging experience.
Every starting group gets judged by another starting group.
If there is only one group, it can be split to have two groups.
The judging table consists of at least 5 Judges.

## Judging
Every routine is judged by the judging table.
One judging table stays for one starting group.
Judges can judge alone or in pairs.
The only thing a judge has to do, is to bring the riders of the current starting group in order.
There is no special judging form.
Every jugde gets a blank sheet of paper and can use any system he/she wants to create the order.
The only restriction is to not take any negative aspect into account (for example dismounts).
Only fully landed skills count.
A skill is fully landed when the rider reaches a stable position during the skill.
All the placing points get summed up for each rider.
The 3 riders with the fewest points win and advance to the next round.
If there is only one group left, it gets judged by a group of riders from the last round.
